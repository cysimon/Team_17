Some basic instructions you need to follow when contributing to the game...
1. Use your lab scene to create everything new that you want to add to the game.
2. NEVER use the Production Scene to make things.
3. Please store all audios using google drive. I gitignore the Audios folder so that they will not be on github
4. Credit everything you find on the Internet on Team_17/Credits.txt
5. If you need help on finding something or putting something into the game, let Simon know

Have fun!
